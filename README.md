# Overview 

## Project I : Generative Modeling of Complex data densities 
1. Modeling with single Norm distribution
2. Mixture of Gaussian 
3. T-distribution

## Project II : Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) for Face Detection
To boost the performance of the face detection, `Haar-Like feature` (weak learner) is used as an input of Adaboost classifier.





## Project III : Babysitting the training of Deep Neural Network (DNN)





* ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) - a graph shows the performance of the model
- TPR (True Positive Rate) = TP / (TP + FN)
- FPR (False Positive Rate)= FP / (FP + TN)
